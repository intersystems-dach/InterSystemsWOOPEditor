# Hello World

1. Open a new file in your favorite text editor and save it as `Hello.java`.
2. Copy the following code into the file:

```java
public class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ...
    }
}
```

3. Replace the `...` so that "_Hello World_" will be printed to the console.
